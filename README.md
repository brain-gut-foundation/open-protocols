# Open Protocols

**Open Protocols** is an initiative of **The Brain–Gut Foundation**.

This repository publishes **open, evidence-based protocols for brain–gut interventions**, intended for use by researchers, clinicians, developers, and the global community.

The focus of this repository is on **methods and protocol structure**, not on commercial products, therapeutic claims, or individual outcomes.

---

## Scope

This repository may include:

- Structured intervention protocols
- Protocol components and session structures
- Fidelity and evidence criteria
- Safety boundaries and exclusions
- Supporting documentation for reproducibility

All material published here is grounded in **peer-reviewed research** and clearly labeled by evidence level.

---

## What this repository does NOT provide

- Medical advice or diagnosis  
- Personalized therapy  
- Guarantees of effectiveness  
- Replacement for professional clinical care  

All protocols are provided for **educational, research, and implementation reference purposes only**.

---

## Current focus

The first project published in this repository will be:

- Open, research-faithful protocols derived from the **North Carolina (NC) gut-directed hypnotherapy framework**, adapted for transparency, reproducibility, and open access.

This is one project among many that may be published here over time.

---

## Governance

This repository is maintained under the principles of:

- Evidence-based inclusion
- Methodological transparency
- Safety and ethical clarity
- Open contribution with review

Contribution guidelines and review criteria will be published as the repository evolves.
