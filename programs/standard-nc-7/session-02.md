# Session 2: Directed Regulation (The Flow)

**ID:** `standard-nc-7-02`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Target Duration:** ~20–25 Minutes
**Goal:** Introduce specific gut-directed imagery; normalize motility using flow metaphors.

## Notes

The "Pivot": Section 3 (Solar Plexus) serves as the bridge. We move from the "Whole Body" (Session 1) to the "Center" (Session 2) using warmth as the entry vector.

The Metaphor: The River is the canonical functional metaphor. It works because it describes mechanics (flow, speed, resistance) rather than magic.

The Instruction: Notice the phrase "You do not need to push the water." This targets the hyper-vigilance common in IBS patients (constantly "checking" their gut).

## 0. Preparation
*Assume the same comfortable position as in the previous sessions. You are now familiar with the process of relaxation.*

## 1. Induction (Shortened)

Fix your eyes on a spot on the wall or ceiling. Just as you have done before.
Take a deep breath in... and breathe out slowly.
With the next breath out, let your eyes close.

You know this feeling. You have practiced this.
Your body remembers how to let go.
Send that wave of relaxation instantly down from your head to your toes.
Face smooth. Shoulders dropping. Arms heavy. Legs loose.

[PAUSE 10 SECONDS]

## 2. Deepening (The Count)

I am going to count from 5 down to 1.
With every number, you go twice as deep as you were before.
**5.** Letting go of all outside sounds.
**4.** Sinking into the surface beneath you.
**3.** Your mind is becoming quiet and still.
**2.** Drifting down into that safe, comfortable place.
**1.** Deeply relaxed.

## 3. The Solar Plexus (Central Warmth)

Bring your attention to the center of your body. To the area just below your ribs, the solar plexus.
This is the center of your nervous system in the body.
Imagine a gentle source of warmth in this area.
Like a small, comforting sun, or a warm heating pad resting on the upper stomach.

Feel this warmth radiating outward.
Spreading down into the abdomen.
Soothing the muscles.
Soothing the nerves.
As the warmth spreads, it relaxes the deep muscles of the digestive tract.
Any knots of tension are simply melting away in this gentle heat.

## 4. The River Metaphor (Motility Regulation)

Now, visualize your digestive system.
You don't need to see it perfectly anatomically; just imagine it as a long, winding channel.
Imagine it like a peaceful river winding through a quiet landscape.

Think about the flow of a river.
When a river is healthy, it flows smoothly.
It does not rush. It does not stop.
It moves in a steady, rhythmic current. Downstream. Always downstream.

[PAUSE 10 SECONDS]

Imagine the movement inside your abdomen becoming like that river.
Smooth. Rhythmic. Predictable.
If there was any turbulence before, the water is calming down now.
The banks of the river are soft and yielding. There is no resistance.

**[For Diarrhea-Predominant symptoms]:**
The river slows down. It becomes wide and lazy.
Meandering slowly through the countryside.
Absorbing the water. Becoming calm.

**[For Constipation-Predominant symptoms]:**
The current is strong and steady.
Nothing can block it. It moves effortlessly around obstacles.
Carrying everything with it. Moving freely downstream.

**[Universal Suggestion]:**
The muscles of your digestive tract know exactly what to do.
They are rhythmic. Squeeze... and relax. Squeeze... and relax.
Like the slow, gentle waves of the ocean.
Never too fast. Never too slow.
Just the perfect, natural rhythm of your body.

## 5. Separation of Signal and Noise

While your digestive system works in this smooth, rhythmic way, you realize you do not need to monitor it.
The river flows by itself. You do not need to push the water.
You can stand on the bank and watch it flow, detached and comfortable.

You can let your abdomen do its work without your conscious interference.
You are the observer. You are safe.
The sensations in your stomach are becoming distant.
They are just signals of normal functioning.
Comfortable. Smooth. Quiet.

## 6. Post-Hypnotic Suggestion

When you return to your normal awareness, this sense of flow will continue.
Your digestive system will continue to operate with this new, smooth rhythm.
You will find yourself paying less attention to your stomach.
You will trust your body to handle the digestion, while you focus on your life.

## 6. Post-Hypnotic Suggestion (Bedtime version, replace with the above for bedtime)
As you drift deeper into rest, this sense of flow will continue.
Your digestive system will continue to operate with this new, smooth rhythm **throughout the night**.
You do not need to monitor it. Your subconscious mind will handle the digestion while you sleep.
And when you wake up tomorrow morning, you will feel that trust in your body has grown stronger.
Ready to focus on your life, refreshed and calm.

## 7. Re-Alerting

In a moment, I will count from 1 to 5.
**1.** Feeling the surface beneath you.
**2.** Taking a deep, energizing breath.
**3.** Wiggling your fingers and toes.
**4.** Shoulders moving, head clearing.
**5.** Eyes open. Wide awake and refreshed.

## 7. Sleep Outro (Replace with the above for a bedtime version)

You have done the work. The message has been received.
And now, there is nothing left for you to do.
You do not need to wake up. You do not need to move.

Let the images we discussed simply fade into a pleasant background feeling.
Your body knows how to continue this healing process while you sleep.

Even as your conscious mind drifts away, your deeper mind stays on duty.
Monitoring the flow. keeping the dial turned down.
Protecting your comfort throughout the night.

I am going to stop talking in a moment.
And when I do, you will simply continue to drift.
Drifting down from this state of relaxation... into a natural, restorative sleep.
Heavy. Comfortable. Safe.
Allowing the body to rest completely.
Goodnight.
