# Session 5: Self-Efficacy (The Driver)

**ID:** `standard-nc-7-05`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Target Duration:** ~20 Minutes
**Goal:** Build psychological resilience; shift from "passenger" (victim) to "driver" (active manager).
**Key Clinical Feature:** This script tackles the "sick role" identity. Many chronic patients feel like victims of their bodies. By using the Driver vs. Passenger metaphor, we shift the Locus of Control internally, reinforcing that they are in charge, even if the road gets bumpy.

## Notes
The Shift: We move from "my stomach hurts" (sensation) to "I can handle it" (cognition). This is essential for long-term maintenance.

The Distinction: The phrase "You are the driver. You are not the car" is a powerful cognitive re-framing tool. It helps de-pathologize the patient's identity.

Realism: We acknowledge "bumps in the road." We don't promise a perfectly smooth road (which would be a lie); we promise that the user can steer through the bumps.

## 0. Preparation
*Sit or lie down comfortably. By now, this position is a signal to your body to instantly relax. You are building a skill of rapid self-control.*

## 1. Induction (Confidence)

Fix your eyes. Deep breath in.
Close your eyes.
As you settle down today, notice how much easier this has become.
You have trained your mind. You have trained your body.
You are already demonstrating control just by being here.
Let that feeling of competence wash over you.
You are good at this. You are capable.
Drifting down... confident and calm.

## 2. Deepening (The Mountain Road)

Imagine you are standing at the top of a high hill or mountain, looking out over a vast landscape.
The air is clear and crisp. You can see for miles.
Below you, winding through the hills, is a long road.
This represents the journey you are on.
From up here, the road looks manageable. You can see the turns. You can see the straightaways.
It is just a road. And you are ready to travel it.

## 3. The Driver Metaphor (Locus of Control)

Imagine yourself now in a vehicle, driving along this road of life.
For a long time, you may have felt like a **passenger** in your own body.
Think about what it feels like to be a passenger.
You are sitting in the back seat. You can't reach the pedals. You can't touch the wheel.
When the car hits a bump, you tense up because you didn't see it coming.
You feel helpless. You are just along for the ride, hoping nothing goes wrong.

**But that has changed.**

See yourself now climbing into the **driver's seat**.

Feel the steering wheel in your hands.
Feel the pedals under your feet.
Adjust the mirrors.
You are now the driver.

## 4. Handling the Road (Resilience)

As you drive, you realize that being the driver feels very different.
You are looking ahead. You are anticipating.
If there is a bump in the road—a stressful day, a difficult meal, a challenge—you see it coming.
You don't panic. You simply adjust your steering. You slow down slightly.
You absorb the bump and keep going.

Because you are holding the wheel, the bumps don't scare you.
You know how to handle the machine.
You know where the brakes are. You know where the accelerator is.
You have the "Control Room" dial from the last session.
You have the "Anchor" in your hand.
You are fully equipped.

## 5. Separation of Identity

As you drive effortlessly along this road, you realize something important.
**You are the driver. You are not the car.**
Sometimes the car might make a noise. Sometimes the engine grumbles.
That is just the machine. It is not *you*.

You are the intelligent, capable mind controlling the machine.
You are strong. You are resilient.
You do not define yourself by the car you drive.
You are a person with hopes, dreams, skills, and relationships.
The digestive symptoms are just background noise in the back seat.
They do not touch the steering wheel. Only you touch the steering wheel.

## 6. The Healthy Self

Feel a sense of strength rising in your chest.
This is your **Healthy Self**.
It is the part of you that makes plans.
The part of you that laughs with friends.
The part of you that is creative and productive.
That part is growing stronger every day.
It is taking up more space in your life.
The illness is shrinking into the background, becoming smaller and less significant.

## 7. Post-Hypnotic Suggestion

When you open your eyes, you will carry this "Driver's Mindset" with you.
When you make decisions about food, or travel, or work, you will make them as the Driver.
Not out of fear, but out of confidence.
You trust your ability to handle whatever comes up.
You are in charge.

## 8. Re-Alerting

Bringing the car to a smooth stop.
Turning off the engine, feeling satisfied with the journey.
**1.** Returning to the room.
**2.** Feeling strong and capable.
**3.** Taking a deep, confident breath.
**4.** Shoulders back, head high.
**5.** Open your eyes. Ready to drive.
