Fix your eyes on a spot on the wall or ceiling. Keep your eyes fixed on that one spot. Do not look away.

Take a deep breath in... filling the lungs completely. And breathe out slowly... letting the air flow out.

Take another deep breath in... And as you breathe out, let your eyelids become heavy. So heavy that they want to close. Just let them close now. That’s right.

Let your eyes rest comfortably behind your closed eyelids. You are beginning to turn your attention inward. Exclude the outside world. The noises outside are not important. You are focusing only on the sound of my voice and the feeling of relaxation beginning to develop in your body.

Focus your attention on your forehead. Smooth out the muscles of the forehead. Let go of any frowning or tension. Let the eyebrows drop.

Move your attention down to your eyes. Let the tiny muscles around the eyes relax completely. Let your jaw hang loose. Unclench your teeth. Let your tongue rest gently in the bottom of your mouth. Your entire face is becoming soft and relaxed
Take a deep breath in... And breathe out slowly... 

Let that wave of relaxation flow down into your neck. Let the muscles of the neck become loose and limp. Let your shoulders drop down. Let them drop further down, releasing the tension of the day.

Allow the relaxation to flow down your arms. Through the elbows. Into the forearms. Through the wrists. Into the hands. Right to the tips of the fingers. Your arms feel heavy and loose, like dead weight resting at your sides.

Now focus on your breathing. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest. With every breath out, you feel yourself settling deeper into the surface beneath you. Let your back muscles relax. From the top of the spine... slowly down... vertebrae by vertebrae... to the lower back. Letting go of all tension in the back.

Let your stomach muscles soften. There is no need to hold any tension there. Just let the abdomen be soft and loose. Let the relaxation flow into your hips and thighs. Down through the knees. Into the calves. Through the ankles. Into the feet and toes.

Your entire body is now physically relaxed. Heavy, comfortable, and still.

In a moment, I am going to count from 10 down to 1. With each number, you will feel yourself drifting down into a deeper, more pleasant state of relaxation. Imagine a staircase. It can be any kind of staircase you like. You are at the top, looking down.

10. Stepping down onto the first step. Moving deeper. 9. Feeling more and more comfortable. 8. Letting go of conscious thought. 7. Drifting down. 6. Your body feels safe and supported. 5. Halfway down. Deeper and deeper. 4. A pleasant feeling of detachment. 3. Almost at the bottom. 2. Deeper still. 1. Step off the staircase onto a soft, comfortable floor.

You are now in a state of deep, focused relaxation. Your mind is aware, but your body is asleep.

Take a deep breath in... And breathe out slowly... 

In this state of deep relaxation, let a scene form in your mind. This is a place where you feel perfectly safe, perfectly calm, and completely at ease. It might be a place you have visited before—a beach, a forest, a mountain cabin. Or it might be a place you have created in your imagination.

Look around this place. Notice what you see. Notice the colors. The light. Maybe there is the blue of the sky, or the green of trees, or the calming colors of a comfortable room.

Notice what you hear in this safe place. Maybe the sound of gentle waves. Or the wind in the trees. Or simply a profound, comforting silence.

Notice the temperature. It is exactly the temperature you enjoy most. Warm and soothing, or cool and refreshing.

You are completely alone here. There are no demands on you. No one needs anything from you. This is your sanctuary. In this place, your nervous system can switch off its alarms. You are safe. You are protected. You are in control.

Take a deep breath in... And breathe out slowly... 

Feel the sense of peace soaking into you. Every time you visualize this place, you reconnect with this feeling of deep safety. This feeling of safety tells your brain that it does not need to be vigilant. It can rest. Your body is recharging. Your mind is clearing.

Take a deep breath in... And breathe out slowly... 
You will find that this feeling of relaxation stays with you after you open your eyes if you wish to. The things that used to bother you will seem less important. You are becoming calmer, more confident, and more at ease in your body.
