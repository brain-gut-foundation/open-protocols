# Session 6: Normalization (Future Pacing)

**ID:** `standard-nc-7-06`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Target Duration:** ~20–25 Minutes
**Goal:** Desensitize triggers by visualizing realistic future scenarios (eating, traveling) with confidence.
**Key Clinical Feature:** The brain struggles to distinguish between a vivid visualization and reality. By rehearsing "normal" behavior (eating out, traveling) without anxiety in trance, we lay the neural tracks to do it comfortably in real life.

## Notes
The "In Vitro" Test: This session tests the user's confidence. If they feel anxiety during the visualization, the script gently guides them back to the "Driver" mindset.

Specificity: We target the "Big Three" IBS fears: Food (Restaurant), Bathroom Access (Travel), and Performance (Work).

Neuroplasticity: Section 6 explicitly explains why we are doing this ("Overwriting old files"). This cognitive reinforcement helps the user buy into the process.

## 0. Preparation
*Sit or lie down. You are now an expert at this process. Today requires active imagination, so ensure you are alert enough to visualize clearly.*

## 1. Induction (The Rapid Count)

Fix your eyes. Deep breath in... and out. Eyes closed.
You know the way.
Instantly letting the muscles of the face smooth out.
Shoulders down. Hands heavy.
Allowing that wave of comfort to sweep through the body.
**5.** Going down.
**4.** Deeper.
**3.** Past the noise of the day.
**2.** Into the quiet center.
**1.** Deeply relaxed and attentive.

## 2. Deepening (The Timeline)

Imagine a line stretching out in front of you. This is your timeline.
It represents your future.
In the past, looking at this line might have caused worry or uncertainty.
But today, looking forward, the line is bright, clear, and open.
You are going to float out along this timeline.
Drifting forward in time... to next week... next month...
Seeing yourself in the future.
You look strong. You look healthy. You look at ease.

## 3. Scenario A: The Social Meal (Eating Without Fear)

Let’s step into a specific scene in this future.
Visualize yourself sitting at a table in a restaurant, or at a dinner party with friends.

See the environment clearly. Hear the chatter of conversation. Smell the food.

Notice specifically how **you** are feeling.
In the past, you might have been scanning the menu with anxiety, or mapping out where the bathroom is.
**But look at yourself now.**
You are relaxed. You are leaning back in your chair.
You are engaged in the conversation, laughing, listening.

The food arrives.
See yourself eating.
You are eating normally. You are enjoying the flavors.
Your stomach is comfortable. The "River" is flowing smoothly.
You are trusting your body to do its job.
You are not thinking about digestion; you are thinking about the company you are with.
Feel the freedom of that moment. The normalcy of it.

## 4. Scenario B: Travel and Movement

Now let that scene fade and move to another scenario.
See yourself traveling.
Maybe you are in a car, on a train, or walking some distance from home.


Notice your posture.
You are not tense or gripping the seat.
You are looking out the window, enjoying the scenery.
You have the "Control Room" dial set to low.
The background noise is filtered out.

You realize you have a sense of **capacity**.
You know that if you need to stop, you can. But you don't *need* to right now.
You are the Driver. You are in control of the journey.
Feel the confidence of moving through the world without a tether.
You are free to go where you want to go.

## 5. Scenario C: Work and Focus

Finally, see yourself engaged in a task—at work, at a hobby, or in a meeting.
You are deeply focused on what you are doing.
Your mind is sharp. Your attention is on the task.
Your body is simply the support vehicle, quiet and reliable in the background.
You have reclaimed your focus.
You are not distracted by symptoms.
You are productive. You are present.

## 6. The Rehearsal Effect

Understand what you have just done.
You have just practiced success.
Your brain has now recorded these memories of success.
**It knows you can do it.**

Every time you visualize these scenes, you strengthen the neural pathway for "Normalcy."
You are overwriting the old files of "Fear" with new files of "Confidence."
This is your new reality.
Eating with pleasure. Traveling with ease. Living with focus.

## 7. Post-Hypnotic Suggestion

When you actually find yourself in these situations in the coming days and weeks, this feeling will return.
You will sit down at a restaurant, and your body will remember this relaxation.
You will get into a car, and your nerves will remain calm.
It will happen automatically.
You have rehearsed it. You are ready.

## 8. Re-Alerting

Coming back now from the timeline.
Returning to the present moment, bringing that confidence back with you.
**1.** Feeling your body in the chair.
**2.** Taking a deep, satisfying breath.
**3.** Wiggling fingers and toes.
**4.** Stretching the arms.
**5.** Open your eyes. Ready for your life.
