# Program Outline: Canonical NC-7 Standard

**ID:** `standard-nc-7`
**Status:** Draft / Spec
**Origin:** Adapted from North Carolina Protocol (Palsson et al.)
**Format:** 7 Unique Audio Sessions
**Dosage:** Bi-weekly administration (14-week total duration)
**Evidence Tier:** A (Canonical Reference)

## 1. The Clinical Logic
This protocol is not a "playlist." It is a conditioning regimen. The efficacy relies on **repetition** and **neural consolidation**.

* **Acquisition (Day 1 of a new session):** The user is introduced to a new cognitive frame.
* **Consolidation (Days 2–14):** Daily repetition habituates the brain to the new signal, moving it from conscious effort to autonomic automaticity.



## 2. Administration Schedule
*Standard clinical administration assumes a 12–14 week timeline.*

| Phase | Duration | Content | User Action | Clinical Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | Weeks 1–2 | **Session 1** | Listen Daily | Establish trance capability; dissociate pain processing. |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 3–4 | **Session 2** | Listen Daily | Introduce gut-specific functional imagery. |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 5–6 | **Session 3** | Listen Daily | Somatic anchoring (Hand-on-Stomach technique). |
| **Phase 4** | Weeks 7–8 | **Session 4** | Listen Daily | Visceral sensitivity reduction (The "Dial"). |
| **Phase 5** | Weeks 9–10 | **Session 5** | Listen Daily | Ego strengthening; separation of identity from illness. |
| **Phase 6** | Weeks 11–12 | **Session 6** | Listen Daily | Future pacing; visualization of normalized life. |
| **Phase 7** | Weeks 13+ | **Session 7** | As Needed | Maintenance toolkit; relapse prevention. |

## 3. Session Functional Specifications
*Contributors must adhere to these functional goals when drafting scripts. Do not use proprietary text.*

### Session 1: The Foundation (Dissociation)
* **Goal:** Train the brain to enter a receptive state and dissociate from somatic stress.
* **Key Imagery:** "Safe Place" (nature/comfort), progressive muscle relaxation.
* **Constraint:** No specific mention of the gut yet. Focus on the *whole body* and *safety*.

### Session 2: Directed Regulation (The Flow)
* **Goal:** Introduce the link between brain relaxation and gut function.
* **Key Imagery:** Metaphors of smooth flow (river, gentle waves) applied to the digestive tract.
* **Constraint:** Use mechanical/functional metaphors, not magical or spiritual ones.

### Session 3: The Anchor (Somatic Bridge)
* **Goal:** Create a physical trigger for the relaxation response.
* **Key Imagery:** Placing the hand on the stomach; visualizing warmth transferring from hand to gut.
* **Constraint:** Must involve the physical instruction to place the hand on the abdomen.

### Session 4: Sensitivity Gating (The Control Room)
* **Goal:** Reduce visceral hypersensitivity (lowering the pain volume).
* **Key Imagery:** A control room, dial, or lever that controls nerve sensitivity. Distinguishing "signal" (useful) from "noise" (pain).
* **Constraint:** Reinforce that the user has control over the *perception* of the signal.

### Session 5: Self-Efficacy (The Driver)
* **Goal:** Psychological resilience and confidence.
* **Key Imagery:** Moving from "passenger" to "driver." Strengthening the "healthy self."
* **Constraint:** Focus on the person's capability, not the illness's severity.

### Session 6: Normalization (Future Pacing)
* **Goal:** Re-integrating into normal life.
* **Key Imagery:** Visualizing oneself eating, traveling, or working without fear.
* **Constraint:** Scenarios must be realistic everyday activities, not fantasy.

### Session 7: Maintenance (The Toolkit)
* **Goal:** Long-term independence.
* **Key Imagery:** Rapid re-induction cues. Summarizing previous tools.
* **Constraint:** Explicitly framing this as a tool for "flare-ups" or maintenance, ending the need for daily full sessions.
